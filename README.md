## Real World Assets on the Blockchain

### RWAOS tokenized property model on Solana

As Real World Assets (RWAs) continue gaining momentum in crypto, the infrastructure to
support them remains fragmented and inefficient. Traditional blockchains struggle to provide the
compliance, performance, and transparency needed to bring RWAs fully on-chain.
RWAOS is the first RWA-optimized Layer 2 built on Solana, purpose-built to tokenize,
manage, and transact real-world value with speed and compliance.

### Solana vs Ethereum for Tokenized Real Estate

Feature           Ethereum (ERC-20)                Solana
Token Standard    ERC-20                           SPL Token
Smart Contracts  Solidity  Rust/Anchor
Wallets  MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet  Phantom, Solflare
Rent distribution  Smart contract automates via stablecoins  SPL program (on-chain logic) + instructions via backend or cron
KYC/Whitelist  Modifier & mapping in Solidity  PDAs/account-based flags
Transactions per second  ~30‚Äì100  Thousands

### Solana Architecture

1. Create the SPL Token
Each property = 1 SPL token.

bash
Copy
Edit
solana-token create-token
solana-token create-account <TOKEN_MINT>
solana-token mint <TOKEN_MINT> 1000000 <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>
You can script this or use the Solana SDK (TypeScript) for a frontend integration.

üßæ 2. Track Ownership + Whitelisting
In Ethereum you use mappings. On Solana, use accounts or PDAs to store KYC and metadata.

Each investor gets an associated token account (ATA).

KYC whitelisting could be enforced off-chain or with on-chain flags in metadata accounts.

Use something like Token Metadata program for extra structure.

üí∏ 3. Rent Distribution in USDC (SPL)
Collect rent into a central treasury wallet

Use a backend (Node.js, Cronjob, or serverless function) to:

Read holders‚Äô token balances

Calculate proportional shares

Send SPL USDC payments via the Solana SystemProgram.transfer instruction

Can be built as an on-chain Anchor program too, but most projects use off-chain triggers for flexibility.

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 4. Governance (optional)
Use Realms (by SPL Governance) or your own Anchor-based DAO

Allow token holders to vote on:

Sale decisions

Repairs

Manager changes

üõ°Ô∏è 5. KYC/Compliance Options
Solana doesn‚Äôt enforce identity on-chain, but you can:

Use token gating + allow-listing wallets off-chain

Store KYC status in a metadata account

Use Civic or Fractal (ID protocols on Solana)

üß† Tech Stack Suggestion (Solana-Based)

Layer	Tools
Smart Contracts	Anchor (Rust framework for Solana)
Frontend	Next.js + Tailwind + Wallet Adapter (Phantom, Solflare)
Token UI	Solana SPL Token SDK
Rent Handling	Node.js script with @solana/web3.js
Governance	Realms (SPL DAO) or custom Anchor logic
Hosting	Vercel + Firebase/Hasura for metadata
KYC	Civic Pass, Fractal ID, or off-chain checks
